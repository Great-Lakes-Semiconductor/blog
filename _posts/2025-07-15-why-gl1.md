As I iron out the electrical design I've been able to put some time into thinking about what exactly I'm hoping this board will do.

I originally came up with this concept after have spent several months learning semiconductor physics and VSLI design on my free-time. I simply wanted a platform that would emulated how specialized compute modules are used in the real world. 

After spending some time looking for a suitable board I realized that there is not a clear on ramp for an engineer like myself who wants to learn how to build and use custom compute accelerators. I eventually landed on the unique combination of a **Raspberry Pi tightly integrated with a capable FPGA**. I call it the [GL-1 Accelerator Platform](www.glsemi.io). 

My plan is to stay true to the original intent and deliver a high-quality device paired with top-tier documentation for anyone interested in learning. I plan to release a YouTube series of tutorials alongside the GL-1 Founder Kit Pre-Order demonstrating a high quality example of custom compute on this board.

I'm thinking the first series of videos will be centered around implementing a hardware security module (HSM) on the FPGA module and developing an application on the CM5 that makes use of it. 

**What tutorial series should I do? I'm open to feedback**
